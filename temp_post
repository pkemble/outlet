we went to the memphis bbq company for dinner in southaven, MI. we sat at the bar. you could smoke at the bar. it was the only socially distanced place we could find in the place. you have to make compromises as an essential employee during a pandemic. the clientele wasn't what you'd expect in a chain style restaurant. but it was what you'd expect in mississippi, rural mississippi at that. the two men sitting next to us were talking about the recent insurrection at the US capital on january 6th, 2021. talking politics these days is pretty common as things are really fucked up in our present day culture, and only getting worse. then one of the guys says that he kept his mask on the whole time in the crowd in DC because he didn't want to be unsafe. he lives next to his cousin, and his cousin's cousin [sic]. they have hundreds of acres between them all, so they're not worried. then he mentions that he couldn't see trump directly, but only on a screen. he says that he was unable to get into the capital, but because he didn't want to. he wasn't crazy. 'we were all just really pissed off.' his name is daniel kelley. he offered that up to the other guy next to him later in the night, trying to network whatever business he does.
