she logs into the file server and backs up that way without having to go to the file server machine.&lt;br /&gt;Is that correct?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I accidentally clicked many buttons and restarted the file server machine as once I logged in, I didn&#39;t know how to log out.&lt;br /&gt;Is this going to mess anything up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANAGER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the funny thing is that this is a CentOS (Linux) server with no GUI, so physically at the machine is just a console. when she said she &#39;clicked many buttons&#39;, turns out by looking at the server logs she meant the power button, reset button, etc...which i am pretty sure was locked up by the case when i left.</content><link rel='replies'

My manager was confused as expected and questioned the purchase and how it came to be. here&#39;s the director&#39;s response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I asked for comparisons to other projectors. What was the outcome, and why?&lt;br /&gt;Director&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s my response, professional as always :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi Director,&lt;br /&gt;I received the message forwarded from X where you asked her to look into ordering the projector linked below. I verified with Manager as I do with any major purchase and she wanted me to verify which account it should come out of. Also, will this be to replace the one in the conference room? Thanks, sorry for the confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is her (always) unprofessional reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My request was not to just go ahead and purchase this one, but to do some due diligence to make sure we are getting the best value.&amp;nbsp; X and Peter, please could you do this.&amp;nbsp; I think that this was clear from my last email, but perhaps not.&lt;br /&gt;Director&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and my reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I understand now.

Fortunately I&#39;m already doing most, if not all, of what you suggest. ever since i was old enough to read I sponged up anything aviation related. As for goals, mine is simple - fly without having to pay for it and if possible, have flying be my major source of income. whether that&#39;s as FO on an RJ, dropping meat bombs on the weekend, or pulling ads through the sky, it is what it is. my love for flying goes well beyond money, and as far as a comfortable lifestyle...let&#39;s just say i don&#39;t go to bed at night with a smile on my face because I had a really productive day in the cubicle / computer lab / what-have-you, it&#39;s usually because i learned something new with my cfi, or demonstrated something in the air that i&#39;ve only read about in the text books. when I fly I still get the same feeling everytime - *everytime* - that this is the best thing ever, and this is after 12 years of being a professional student. the mix of physics, radios, structure, adventure, whim, and serenity of being up there will never get old. it might get clouded by company politics, low pay, and god forbid, other&#39;s cynicism, but it will always be there to find again. call that sentiment naive, but the grass is always greener. luckily i have a fallback career...but frankly, i&#39;m sick of doing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;becoming a private pilot made me a better person. it effected everything i do, adding structure, analytical thinking and a calm under pressure - things i don&#39;t think i&#39;d ever have uncovered in myself. so that, mixed with what i wrote above, tells me there&#39;s nothing else i should be doing except to continue...IR, CPL, CFI, MEI...and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and I guess ATP now as well :P&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://boycrikey.blogspot.com/feeds/5734929131142398914/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5177650&amp;postID=5734929131142398914' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5177650/posts/default/5734929131142398914'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5177650/posts/default/5734929131142398914'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://boycrikey.blogspot.com/2009/09/why-im-spending-all-this-money-in-air.html' title='why i&#39;m spending all this money in the air'/><author><name>Unknown</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5177650.post-1105856557621593005</id><published>2009-08-09T21:24:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2009-09-02T13:15:47.378-04:00</updated><title type='text'>a great weekend</title><content type='html'>early saturday morning - 8am - i departed in N3572M, type PA28-161, from KBED and tuned in the concord vor, setting my heading to match it&#39;s 359 course. half way to manchester, boston approach verifies that i&#39;m direct to lebanon. &quot;via concord&quot; i reply, &quot;...but i&#39;ll take it directly there at this point.&quot; as i glanced at my watch, the thought of my mother waiting in that terminal in lebanon, wondering why her newly minted private pilot son is 15 minutes late. &quot;roger&quot; back from approach. i can pick up the lebanon vor at this point, so it&#39;s direct there, with route 89 in sight, following me along on the right - a nice would-be curvy emergency runway, should i need it. my co-pilot is claire, she&#39;s probably logged about 20 hours passenger time at this point. she&#39;s good at finding us on the map, great at spotting gliders and other intruders, and is a fantastic companion to have up in the air. about 10 miles out and 5 minutes late already, i ask lebanon tower to call the fbo and tell them i&#39;m 15 minutes out...my mother doesn&#39;t need more to worry about. the very chipper controller gladly agrees and i wonder if everyone is like this at this hour of saturday morning...should i start drinking less on fridays?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my mother is elated. it&#39;s her first time up with me, and i can only wonder at what it&#39;s like to have the toddler who once flew little metal jets around the living room now be piloting a full size airplane with her in it. she&#39;s amazed that i instruct her to keep the warrior&#39;s only door open until we are ready to lift off. it&#39;s hot out, and once the door closes, the tempurature rises sharply in the little greenhouse cockpit. runway 18 is long at KLEB, but one notch of flaps, just to be on the safe side, as the sun is now fully risen and the days heat is upon new england. as we are about 300 feet above the ground, my mother is glued to the window. claire casually explains where the air vents are. i&#39;m trying to ignore that i have the two most important women in my life at the mercy of my flying skill, and doing my best to excersize that skill. i always hate climbout with rising terrain - this departure is one, not as bad as 14 at fitchburg, but close. the warrior lumbers up to 5500, and we are playing with the clouds. along the way i&#39;m pointing out various towns and landmarks, and over KMHT an ERJ-135, the same as my childhood friend flies, passes 300 feet under us &quot;...traffic in sight,&quot; the weary and underpaid FO says concerning us over the radio. at KBED i do a touch and go, and a landing, the 3rd of 3 great landings. it&#39;s only 11am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we met up with dad, headed to the country club in new bedford where my sister in law&#39;s baby shower was being held. on the way i finished my logbook entry, made a new page, and realized that my total time had passed 150 hours somewhere over new hampshire. dad and i were tipsy by 2pm, and jon drove us to eat downtown. after that, we headed over to someone&#39;s friend&#39;s house and had a few more. by midnight, i had been home, eaten, sobered up and was back out with claire at the lodge, barely able to stand being so tired after such a long day. i had a couple greyhounds and headed to bed.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://boycrikey.blogspot.com/feeds/1105856557621593005/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5177650&amp;postID=1105856557621593005' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5177650/posts/default/1105856557621593005'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5177650/posts/default/1105856557621593005'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://boycrikey.blogspot.com/2009/08/great-weekend.html' title='a great weekend'/><author><name>Unknown</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5177650.post-1972154617536776323</id><published>2009-07-23T09:27:00.004-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-24T09:42:13.769-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="employ"/><title type='text'>employ.3</title><content type='html'>boss: hey, can you find out what mailbox server j is on?&lt;br /&gt;me: sure, what&#39;s up?&lt;br /&gt;b: well, some people are on 10, others on 12, they&#39;re, some on 8, you know, its all done alphabetically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I should pause here and note that it is not alphabetical (can you imagine the data shuffling that would have to happen everytime someone was hired / fired?)

However, he is not going to pay shipping, but is going to pick up the guitar as the ad said, since he lives close by. fortunately though, frank rebery, not all hope is lost. he has graciously agreed to have a contest with you so that i may judge who is most worthy of purchasing the guitar from me. He is currently preparing a video of himself playing the guitar, just a brief few minutes, and wishes you to do the same so that i can judge who deserves the guitar more. please let me know which song you will be performing in the video, and get it to me as soon as possible as you only have two weeks before moving to the bahamas where there is no mail to ship things. thank you, and god bless.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-p&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On Tue, Apr 21, 2009 at 2:04 PM, frank rebery &lt;frebery05@gmail.com&gt; wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hello are you selling this to me or not.. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On Tue, Apr 21, 2009 at 2:34 PM, Pete Kemble &lt;pkemble@gmail.com&gt; wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope so! you offered free (paid for shipping) which I cannot turn down!

(i still say that screen is the best to date for a lowend clamshell.) it also got me out of a long term contracted commitment with sprint, the crazy company that sends you feces in the mail, surprises you one day by doing all your laundry and then sleeps with your friend because the birthday present you stole for it wasn&#39;t expensive enough. verizon was good, and fair. the u740 did it&#39;s job and was a breath of fresh air after my sprint razr. (btw, sprint puts their own UI /over/ the existing motorola one. it was like running doom II on a 386 with 4mb ram. some of you know what i&#39;m talking about.) but after a while, i became a little frustrated. you pay for a piece of solid state, it has an OS, it has removable storage, some of them have wifi, gps and a keyboard...but you&#39;re not allowed to access all these things. you want to connect your phone to the computer? that propreitary cable costs money, my friend. you want to import a ringtone of circuit bent malaise you created yourself? no, i don&#39;t think so. here, have this kanye west ringtone from the verizon store. only $0.99. my xv8600 at work has gps, but verizon blocks it...yet it&#39;s running wm6. not even a registry hack will enable it. wtf, verizon? do you want to read my mail before i open it, and perhaps it&#39;d be ok if i spend some time with my guy friends? oh no, of course...i forgot you need someone to help you blow-dry your hair and scrapbook, and yes of course i like this sweater you bought me and are making me wear. when some of my friends started getting iphones, i should have been jealous, but meh. it was only until android actually became a reality that i could be swayed to grow dual nuts and leave the stalwart vzw controlling ice-queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#39;s my take on the g1 THUS FAR;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;camera: completely useless. 0 settings, no flash, has the exposure capabilities of a flashless holga. at night. in a cave. with the lens cap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UI: i&#39;m &#39;clicking&#39; a little longer than i&#39;d like to (more like a brief touch) to activate things. it occasionally will be a little sluggish, but i would like to attribute this to the few custom apps i have running. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;battery life: like driving a hummer with the gas tank of a moped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;customization: a few things could improve here. i&#39;m finding that some things that should be obvious aren&#39;t available. such as, i would like a vibrate when i receive a notification; new e-mail, new text, new g-talk message (oh yes. FUCKING AWESOME.) you can&#39;t edit desktop shortcuts (maybe getting ahead of myself there...it is still just a phone) and the trackball is too slow in regular menus (great in the browser, though.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;durability: eh...i guess it could be worse, a little on the flimsy side but i don&#39;t really care. nice looking phones get stolen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;which brings me to the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY CRAP MY PHONE IS RUNNING LINUX! OH MY FUCKING GOD! everything besides what&#39;s listed above is so totally worth the some $400 this whole conversion has cost me. it&#39;s beautiful, the 3g is fine (although i&#39;m sure there are people who will debate this) it has the full size web, the sound quality is great, and getting around the phone is intuitive and easy. the keyboard is nice (i still say the rubbery XV8600 keypad is the best) and the trackball is a nice addition. overall, i&#39;m pretty psyched to have this phone.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml'

type='text'>bird murder...&quot;burder&quot;</title><content type='html'>in what was supposed to be my solo sign-off unfortunately became my first bird-strike while flying on saturday. on my 3rd (and what was going to be the last) dual pattern on downwind for runway 29 at hanscom, a large seagull / bird met it&#39;s fate with my right wing. for a split second i saw the flash of feathers and bird-ass about 20 feet ahead. i was traveling at roughly 100mph, and it seemed the bird about 25mph. as close calls with birds are not uncommon, they usually will dive off to a side and avoid the plane. we were about 5 feet underneath it, so it basically dove right into the wing. with a sound that was very similar to a &quot;GORPH&quot; the bird literally exploded and left a sizable dent in the wing. fortunately i never lost control of the plane (the strike itself was more like a tap on the shoulder) and bog-bless the designers at Piper, because the plane flew without a problem back to the ramp. below are the pictures of the plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a side-note, i&#39;m bummed not just because i have to wait 3 weeks to fly again (being signed off to solo would be great because i could work off just my schedule) but also being a vegetarian; i&#39;m not supposed to kill things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img
