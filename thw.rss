<title>new year's eve</title>

<description>
Bright eyed tourist bewildered with confusion
<br/>
Talking about impossible train routes to give the illusion
<br/>
That you're a local that you live here just like me
<br/>
And You can't believe you're stuck underground on the t
<br/>
The car jolts through its dirty grease hole
<br/>
Burrowing under boston like an obsolete green mole.
<br/>
Shuddering into arlington station I long to get off
<br/>
But on the platform a throng of tourists oh enough is enough.
<br/>
They're talking of this city and how with it they are in love
<br/>
But they greet me, a local, with a cross eyed blind shove.
<br/>
Pushed back in the train I am, "excuse me please!!"
<br/>
I realize I am in control as they only are up to my knees
<br/>
Wading through festive children who for this is outer space
<br/>
Happy new years kids! Tears stream on painted glittered face
<br/>
Free from the trolley adjusting gloves on my wrists
<br/>
Words muttered under a weary scarf, "mother fucking tourists..."

<description>
virginia beach proper
<br/>
<br/>
staring out at the sea, my 4 year old niece and my elderly parents all in the distance, i thought of her laugh, i thought of her mind, i thought of the way she says the right things that no one else would think of. i thought of her as if my eyes opened, staring at the sun, the dawn, realizing with each wave on the shadowed sand, i was falling in love with her.
<br/>
<br/>
surrounded by beautiful teenage girls basking in the late summer's last breath, laughing, looking at fitted out teenage boys trying to get that early autumn lay. a couple bobs in the waves, hugging kissing laughing. i clutch my nieces hand, she reaches over and strokes my balding head. she asks if she can go out further in the water. she responds to my 'no' with an equally terse 'why?' because you're not old enough. besides, your mom would kill me.
<br/>
<br/>
later still
<br/>
<br/>
please please please release me from this. i long to sleep in my own bed. i long to be with my friends. i long to be at my local. i love you. i have fallen in love with you, friend. this afternoon surrounded by virginia teenage heat, i have fallen in love with you.

<link>https://theheardworld.blogspot.com/2007/07/in-bar-few-nights-ago-i-turned-back-to.html</link>
<description>in the bar a few nights ago i turned back to eva and i said, 'sometimes i wonder if other people can see and hear you too'. a guardian angel in my life, a life that at times i recognize as being one that i shouldn't have right now, if it had not been for her unlimited kindness and compassion. when things are at their bleakest, when i have to fight back tears, madness and anxiety, it is her being, her voice which keeps me from fading completely from consciousness by my own hand. she is patient, she is lovely, she transcends all other people in my life as someone who sees beyond regular interaction. she is without context, which is not needed when i am with her. she knows what i am thinking at all times, a look at me in the bar, across from seven or eight people, she shakes her head, mouthing a 'no'. she knows i am thinking inside about becky, hurting myself. she is the best medication anyone could ask for. when i am alone at home, on the verge of an anxiety attack, further sinking into an abyss, tortured by memories of jane, of becky, of happier times wasted, i get a text message from her. she says 'smile'. while at work i am having trouble concentrating, biting back tears, trying to remain professional, i get a message from her that somewhere in the world wherever she is, she loves and cares about me. i really wonder if sometimes other people can see or hear her too. eva is trully a reason to believe that there is a higher power out there looking after us, sending us angels.</description>

<title>an isolationist</title>
<link>https://theheardworld.blogspot.com/2007/07/isolationist.html</link>
<description>
this is not an easy task which is laid out before me. to stop searching without, to stop seeking the external, but to lay a seed inside and allow it to grow through only my actions, and only my forward and global thinking. these dark thoughts, thoughts of ruining new relationships of my ex, thoughts of murder and suicide must be stricken from this journey.
<br/>
<br/>
the dull roar and unending lightening strikes of adrenaline through my stomach has now given way to it's former occupant, depression. i miss things. i long after things. i miss the comfort, although in retrospect i must remember that it was not comfort at all. comfort i have found in the fleeting moments of positive thinking. they happen once every two days or so and catch me off guard. it's been 30 years, but i must found out what the fuck i am doing here. i have to be above the bullshit of my exes. i have to be above the drama, and the pain that these situations have caused. soon enough she will wise up, and realize that i am making her unhappy and she will cut me off from her world. i anticipate this sting 10-fold. i have been through months upon months of depression, unhappiness, fear and emotional isolation. all because of a night in amsterdam. when do i stop being punished for all this?

<description>healing your heart is a mother of a bitch. wandering through memories and negative feelings, trying to re-wire the synapses that she tore apart can only be marked by the constant need for outside attention and distraction. alcohol gives us neither, but lubricates that process of sliding ever deeper into agony, a caustic abyss of wondering, tormenting yourself over every last molecule of your surroundings with her lovely face, the face that will no longer gaze on you longlingly, but instead will hapr on strange men's stomachs, ever emasculating you into deeper anger, loathesome self hatred, and the feeling that your stomach will explode in a hail of vomit all over the morning paper, all over the crossword puzzle that you wish would distract you from the separation anxiety, the addiction to the way she used to say she loved you. it's all shit, isn't it? we can only persevere. we can only overcome. we can only live on another day.</description>

<description>in utter abject misery i have lived the last 4 days. i worry what is happening to my body. i worry so much about everything. she, jane, toys so awfully with my heart, which in turn takes it out on my sanity. this utter heartbreak is more than i can bear. i never want to feel this badly again. never do i want to lose love again. never do i want to feel the soft touch of deception. the sting of rejection. i hate this. my mind is an absolute warzone and i worry about my synaptical health. i must look at things objectively. i cannot lose sight of being happy. i cannot lose sight on perspective. i will overcome this pain as i have every other time. i will overcome this too. life is not over. be good. be reasonable. don't give in to fears.for fuck's sake stay on top of it all and don't give in. don't follow down mental ambushes. keep it light. don't think too hard about it. i will overcome. for the sake of my life, for the sake of staying alive, i will overcome this pain.</description>

<description>
'that's just the thing' said the sneaker to the toes. 'it's what holds us together, the fabric between us,' said the sneakers to the toes. 'everyday you work me over, kicking me relentlessly while i envelope and protect you. day in, day out, you work me over completely. with socks a shroud over your dead feet, like funeral clothe, relentless pounding of the toes. never ending, permanent distress, pounding, pounding, pounding. and when the day comes, and it will, when i am old and worn to bits, there is no gold, no reward, no sunset or goal, just tossed aside in trash and left to rot in bins and holes. you get a new pair to fill your needs, leaving me to be lonely till the day when i am recognizable no more.'...said the sneakers to the toes.
<br/>
<br/>
i cannot stand being around people that talk to me, yet being in the presence of kind people as ins the case here usually, i would rather not talk, but write. i like crowds so long as i am not noticed or or involved. (you must be crazy to be reading this).
<br/>
<br/>
in gusts and gales these hateful winds blow back and forth, forcing me in and shutting myself out. oh dear bog, it's miserable living here on the outskirts of life, looking in through the window from which i jumped out, looking and praying for a way even further out. a drunken mess one night, a blubbery baby the next. to no end this haze envelopes, no more dutch girls to steer my heart in ways of err. far loneliness past, in hollow existance i am leaving myself to dogs of indecision, they knaw, but not know what to knaw on next, yet forever eating away at me as a whole. disgusting, vile, and autonamous, i, who doesn't know where he's going, and cannot remember where he's been.

<description>
-PJ Ryans
<br/>
<br/>
there are so many awful things about beautiful women.
<br/>
heart breakingly swoon inducing
<br/>
short of breath making girls.
<br/>
the ones with the hair tempered just right
<br/>
tied up and bound hairstyles or those in [premeditated] disarray
<br/>
molested and disheveled so beautifully by winter hats on the train.
<br/>
i stare.
<br/>
i cannot look away.
<br/>
they don't look, not even a glance, and my mind faints in pain.
<br/>
all productive thoughts cease and turn to the very singularity that cannot be ignored for another therapy session
<br/>
that it kills your spirit that you cannot be good enough the be with them
<br/>
never just right in their so specific idea of the perfect man.
<br/>
you are a square peg to their unattainable and ode lauding hole.
<br/>
but the most depressing part is when they notice you
<br/>
a glance
<br/>
a notification
<br/>
perhaps even a vague, distant and forced smile.
<br/>
that's when reality sets in
<br/>
reality that cannot go unspoken for another therapy session
<br/>
the very thought of being with them.
<br/>
making love to them
<br/>
waking up next to them
<br/>
meeting all their insipid friends and robotic, brain-dead parents
<br/>
having this thing that you need in your life like nothing else
<br/>
berate you
<br/>
and tell you in exacting ways how you don't live up
<br/>
to standards you know nothing of
<br/>
having fight after fight after fight over something thats insignificance can only be further diminished by the fact that in 80 years none of it will mean a thing.
<br/>
two rotting corpses an infinite dimensional distance away from each other.
<br/>
it's enough to give your stoney blank expression
<br/>
the one saved specifically for public transportation
<br/>
a jolt into an expression
<br/>
even a sneer or worse.
<br/>
but then it's all over.
<br/>
those eyes
<br/>
those legs
<br/>
those hips hidden beneath a thick jacket
<br/>
those beautiful heartbreaking eyes
<br/>
that hair you pine for
<br/>
to let on pillows that will only ever exist in imagination
<br/>
gets up
<br/>
floats to the door
<br/>
the skirts
<br/>
the ever present bag
<br/>
and walks out of the car
<br/>
left or right
<br/>
she goes
<br/>
with not one look
<br/>
with not one instance of acknowledgment
<br/>
that you ever graced her visage with the adoration and disgust that will exude from your pen and fester in your mind the whole time you sit at this blessed bar
<br/>
drowning over and over and over again.

<title>public pees</title>
<link>https://theheardworld.blogspot.com/2006/11/public-pees.html</link>
<description>
red line 27oct06
<br/>
a never ending uphill battle is the commute home.
<br/>
bladder fills, tension growing
<br/>
as is the need for urine-baby seed sowing
<br/>
a toilet in the quiet mist is what i seek
<br/>
public toilets make me weak
<br/>
in the knees, like packed train bum breeze
<br/>
could you leave me alone in here please?
<br/>
tension strikes a hot nasty hammer of urethral release
<br/>
my soppy pant legs attract unwanted attention
<br/>
from children and police.
<br/>
another laundry day needed, 10 days a week
<br/>
have pity on me, fluid containment failures are not chic
<br/>
and so i sit here, thighs a stinging
<br/>
from the drying pee, in all the misery its bringing
<br/>
a slow walk home, relishing strong drying gales
<br/>
wondering what it is that separates me from other males
<br/>
could it be that it is not such a problem with me
<br/>
but just that they are afraid to be free?
<br/>
free to pee?
<br/>
wherever one likes, and wherever one needs?
<br/>
oh, the joys of public pees.

<link>https://theheardworld.blogspot.com/2006/10/conglomeration-of-bach-playing.html</link>
<description>
A conglomeration of bach playing. From my youth, ah the memories of angry adolescence, stern harpsichord muddlings. The pain of imagining her not in rapture with me. The rejection, the utter lack of responsibility in every facet of life. The mistakes that were made:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"come one, come all! it's an evening of the half-drunk should-have-been butchering the classics! from beethoven to chopin, from liszt to debussy! see him falter and stumble his way through the old favourites that once poured from his fingers the music which once made niaive schoolgirls cry with empathy, now make you cry with embarrassment! tickets aren't limited, and there's plenty of seats to fill, always an empty house ready to accomodate anyone willing to endure his interesting interpretations of what used to be talent, but now is empty rememberance, not even a shadow of the music that filled concert halls, but now a tattering on cheap instrument, and the gutteral noises of swill infecting his throat.a horrible time to be had by all, experiencing the groans between the tankering of awful, wrong notes, a clanging of meaningless phrases and jolted melodies. now the stinking, bleates of his no good plastic imitation ivory goddess, hardly, but a whore of musical instrument. it is no good alcohol, and useless nostalgia that makes him 'play'. only a former idea of what could have been, what should have been, the art in him that has now been replaced by cold, heartless servers, and hot polluting internal combusting contraptions. the talent has been lost, never to return. the motivation to slave away filled by a drudging familiarity that is the female posession. the love that has been lost to age, bitterness, and a loss of hope in those things that were taught not as fairy tales in his youth but as a goal to be attained."
<br/>
<br/>
but were they mistakes that add to the beauty of learning the notes? I play them even worse now.

<title>high power luncheon</title>
<link>https://theheardworld.blogspot.com/2006/10/high-power-luncheon.html</link>
<description>Among unhappy cold grey buildings by south station there is no beauty. a thousand times before I have seen her face. a thousand times before I have seen that look of discontent and mild disgust and aversion. It's the same look I give the buildings in which these women dwell all day. I believe that a good amount of anger is generated in these places for them.</description>

<link>https://theheardworld.blogspot.com/2002/06/fucking-weird.html</link>
<description>Fucking weird. Here I hope will follow a documentation of some of the weird things that have been happenning to me in this cold town in the past 7 days. Last Wednesday I went out to Our House with Nora and her roommate ricardo. He was cool, and is interested in being in my riot boy band. I think the idea might work out. So this chick approaches us, and asks for a cigarette. She’s tanya, and she’s out o work, and all upset that she has $17 dollars left to her name. So I sympathise having been in the same situation, and give her 2. since she’s bitter, frustrated and kind of punk looking, I offer her to sing some stuff that I would write for her. She doesn’t sing, but leaves me a number anyway, and an e-mail address. Later on, I’m coming back from the bathroom, and she invites me over to her table where she’s with a friend, amanda. Amanda’s frigin’ hot, but has a boyfriend, so that’s that, however tanya giving me signals, and I say what the hell. So it turns out she’s only 20, but her fake id says she’s 29. good enough. We decide to go to the rest of mod night at the common ground around midnight. The bouncers don’t buy her fake id, so we have to go to the kells, the allston meatmarket, where they get hit on extensively by just about every sad, pathetic dateless jock there. I’m ready to go, because this tanya chick is provoking all of it, but she insists that I stay. I guess I probably shouldn’t have, since this weirdness has gone on long enough, and well, this just can’t turn out to be good a few weeks down the road. We end up back at tanya and amanda’s place, and amanda decided to go to bed. Well, one thing leads to another, and tanya and I end up sleeping together. I get home at 6:30, bright and early with only an hour and a half of sleep under my belt. Work sucked that day. That afternoon I call her, and she comes back over.we have sex again. This is looking odd, and we agree to be friends with benefits, because I’m just newly digging this single thing. Yes, for once, things are looking up. So Thursday night Amy, Collins, rob, jenny, and I go to harper’s ferry to see lovewhip, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while. Well, I’m fucking tired as shit, and dancing doesn’t seem to be helping, but lovewhip is like ska, so what the hell? 1.5 hours of sleep, dancing, and here comes the beers! By 12:30 or so, buck dewey comes on, and only amy and I are left. We decide to go over to the common ground for 80’s love night. When we get there, we are greeted by eighties rockers with arm band, leather, leather, and attitude! It’s rough there that night, but amy and I are tired as shit, and still wanna have fun, so we dance it up, with more and more beer. By the time the mosh pit comes around, we decide enough! It’s 1:45 or so, and I’m pooped. I slept well. Friday night rolls around, and after some much enjoyable $6.75 pitchers of micheloeb at the sillhouette lounge with my sister and brother-in-law, I end up meeting up with tanya at her friend chris’ house. They’re all so friekin’ hip, and trendy it hurts. They’re all sitting around thinking it’s funny as shit that as trendy and art school as they are, they still love christine aguilera and britney spears. “can you believe it? Oh my god!” pl-fucking-ease! So tanya and I leave, and get back to my house for inevitable. she goes to the bathroom, and pees, THEN tells me I’m out of toilet paper, and there’s none under the sink. Shit! It’s raining, I’m drunk again, and store 24 Is open down the end of the block. So I run down there to get some more TP, calling people to tell then how I should have gotten her to use a fucking coffee filter, and be done with it. Well, score some TP, and we’re in business. After she gets back home Saturday morning, I went to natick for greg’s rainy barbecue. I meet this chick named MC and she gets all flirty for about 5 minutes, and gets me to talk about going down on girls for a few minutes, before turning totally off again. Fucking girls. What is it? Provocation, then depletion of interest. Fuck it. Then around 10 I head over to a house party on farrington in allston. It’s emily’s graduation party, and I met a bunch of really cool people there. At one point my friend jeremy say, “hey pete, when you’re done down here, come upstairs. There’s another party up there.” Oh yeah! So I go upstairs a few minutes later, and there’s jeremy with two chicks, valerie and allison. Valerie thinks she’s betty fucking page, and allison is completely wasted on oxy-contin. Allison says, “are you staying around, ‘cause the coke will be here soon.” What!? Jesus christ. I turn it down flat, and she says she’ll have sex with me if I do some coke with her. I still turn her down, and she says that she wants to meet someone to have a life, and babies with. I turn her down laughing, and she starts to try to get all serious with me, she gets real close, and says, “what will it take to get you to get high with me, while she starts kind of going for my crotch. Alright, I know I’m kind of an idiot, but please, I’m not that desparate. I turn her down again, and she starts to leave saying she wants to find someone to have life, sex, coke and babies with. Jesus I was laughing so hard. Later on I saw her all over every other guy in the party, asking them the same thing. Apparantly, (jeremy told me earlier) that she thought that she had sex with me before, and that she was convinced that I was a filmographer, but she just couldn’t remember when she had sex with me. Nice girl. Must be like a hot-dog in a bucket. the rest of the night, valerie is making eyes at me, but as soon as I saw the digital camera pictures of her blowing coke, I though, hmmm….nah. so the night ended with me on the porch, smiths on the radio, and a really cool bunch of people hanging out. Sunday was weird too. It was father’s day, and my father came down to visit us, and spent the day with us. At one point I came back home to find 16 bottles of liquor, some unopened, sitting ontop of the trash, along with about $40 worth of unopened food in a plastic bag. I was psyched! The lesbians in number 8 were moving out, and didn’t want to pack all of it, so they said, sure go ahead and take it. Yeah! Fully stocked wet bar in allston, ma.! The story continues on Tuesday night when I had nora, ricardo, collins, amanda and tanya over, and they sampled some of my sweet sweet alcohol collection. We all got trashed, had a great time, and after they all left, tanya stayed, and oh boy, bring on the dirt! She was well-nigh drunk, and I was pretty gone, so we end up screwing, after I begged for condoms from jenny. So I pull out afterwards, and crap!!!!!! No condom. Shit. I tell her to go into the bathroom, fish it out, and get in the bathtub, and wash it out. Wash all that shit out. She starts freaking out, screaming, oh crap, oh crap, I can’t get pregnant! I’m only 20! While I’m going jesus fucking hell, woman get a grip! She’s in the shower, and I’m like, wash it out! She says no, you do it. Oh fer cryin’ out crap! So I’m in the shower, digging with my fingers in her for god knows what, trying to keep my cool, drunk, worried, and alone in my apartment with this newly found-out psycho. She starts trying to make out with me while I’m fishing out the left over penis product, and goddam! I’m trying to do my job here! So later we decide to go to planned parenthood early next morning. Now I’m trying to get some sleep – it’s 3:40 in the morning, and I have to be up at 7, get to pp, then to work by 8:30. shit, now she’s all, oh my god, I’m going to be pregnant, then you have to marry me, and live with me forever! Fucking shit! How the fuck do I end up like this! I know how – I’m a fucking moron. That’s how. at this point, i'm thinking that maybe i should have treated jessie a little better. So then she starts with, do you like me? I like you a lot, and I like you more everyday. Jesus, like I need this shit now! I need fucking sleep, so I can get this chick the morning after pill, get to work, present to sales, and do my job. Well, she finally falls asleep, after this whole, ‘our first fight crap’ and the next morning, I take her to pp, (the goddam jesus – anti – abortion fuckers were there,) and she won’t get an appointment until 10. anyway, I go to work, (on the way out the jesus fuckers tried to get me to rethink tanya’s eminent abortion. I looked right one of them, and said, “get the fuck away from me, asshole!”) I’m freaking out, and later that day it turns out she’s alright. Now how the hell am I going to get out of this? I prolly won’t see her till Friday, so I’m good till then. Man, what a goddam week it’s been.</description>
